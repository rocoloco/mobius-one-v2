Task: Make the landing page fully responsive and mobile-friendly
Step 1: Replace the Landing Page Component
Update client/src/pages/landing.tsx to include proper responsive design with:

Responsive grid layouts that stack on mobile
Flexible text sizing that scales with screen size
Mobile-first approach with proper breakpoints
Responsive padding and margins
Flexible image and content sizing

Key Changes Needed:
Hero Section Fixes:

Change grid from lg:grid-cols-2 to responsive grid
Add responsive text sizes: text-2xl sm:text-3xl md:text-4xl lg:text-5xl
Make button stack vertically on mobile
Add responsive padding: px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8

Features Section Fixes:

Change from lg:grid-cols-3 to grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3
Add responsive padding to cards
Ensure icons and text scale properly

Comparison Table Fixes:

Make table horizontally scrollable on mobile
Add responsive text sizing
Consider stacking table rows on very small screens

Navigation Fixes:

Add mobile hamburger menu if needed
Make buttons stack on mobile
Ensure logo scales properly

Step 2: Add Responsive Utility Classes
Ensure these responsive patterns are used throughout:
javascript// Text sizing
className="text-xl sm:text-2xl md:text-3xl lg:text-4xl"

// Padding/margins  
className="px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8 py-8 sm:py-12 lg:py-16"

// Grid layouts
className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 gap-4 sm:gap-6 lg:gap-8"

// Flex direction
className="flex flex-col sm:flex-row gap-4"

// Width constraints
className="max-w-sm sm:max-w-md md:max-w-lg lg:max-w-xl xl:max-w-2xl"
Step 3: Test Responsive Breakpoints
Ensure the page works well at these breakpoints:

Mobile: 320px - 640px (sm)
Tablet: 640px - 1024px (md/lg)
Desktop: 1024px+ (xl)

Step 4: Fix Specific Problem Areas
Pay special attention to:

Hero text alignment - should center on mobile, left-align on desktop
Button groups - stack vertically on mobile
Feature cards - single column on mobile, 2-3 columns on larger screens
Testimonial cards - single column on mobile
Footer - stack footer sections on mobile

Expected Outcome:
The landing page should smoothly adapt to any screen size without text going off-center or elements breaking the layout. All content should remain readable and properly aligned at every breakpoint.
The main issue is that your current landing page uses fixed layouts without responsive breakpoints, so when the window shrinks, elements don't adapt properly.

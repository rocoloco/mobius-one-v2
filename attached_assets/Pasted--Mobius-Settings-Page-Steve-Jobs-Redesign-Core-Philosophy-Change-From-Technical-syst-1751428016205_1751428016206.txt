## **Design Specifications**

### **Colors & Styling**
```css
/* Connected system cards */
.intelligence-card {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #FAFBFC 0%, rgba(193, 237, 204, 0.1) 100%);
  border: 2px solid #C1EDCC;
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 24px;
  margin-bottom: 16px;
}

/* Recent insight highlight */
.recent-insight {
  background: rgba(4, 139, 168, 0.1);
  color: #048BA8;
  padding: 8px 12px;
  border-radius: 6px;
  font-size: 14px;
  font-style: italic;
}

/* Add new section */
.expand-section {
  background: rgba(4, 139, 168, 0.05);
  border: 2px dashed #048BA8;
  border-radius: 12px;
  padding: 24px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### **Typography**

}
```

## **Remove These Elements**

### **❌ Eliminate Completely**
- "System Connections" technical language
- Test and Configure buttons
- Duplicate system entries
- Technical descriptions like "CRM and sales pipeline data"
- Tab navigation (keep it simple)

### **❌ Hide Technical Details**
- Connection status indicators (unless there's a problem)
- Technical configuration options
- Database-style management interfaces

---

## **Interaction Patterns**

### **1. Adding New Systems**
Instead of "Add System" button, use conversational approach:
```
"What other business tools do you use daily?"
[Search: HubSpot, Zendesk, Slack...]
```

### **2. System Issues**
Only show technical details when there's a problem:
```
⚠️ Salesforce Connection Issue
I haven't been able to access your latest data.
[Fix Connection] [Get Help]
```

### **3. Success States**
Celebrate connections with impact:
```
🎉 NetSuite Connected!
I can now help you with financial insights and cash flow analysis.
Try asking: "Which customers haven't paid this month?"
```

---

## **Progressive Enhancement**

### **Phase 1: Basic Redesign**
- Update language and visual design
- Group by business function, not technical system
- Show capabilities, not technical specifications

### **Phase 2: Intelligence Preview**
- Show sample insights from each connected system
- Preview what becomes possible with new connections
- Dynamic suggestions based on current setup

### **Phase 3: Conversational Setup**
- Guide users through connections with conversation
- "I notice you use Slack - want me to learn from your team communications?"
- AI-driven recommendations for next integrations

---

## **Success Metrics**

### **User Sentiment**
- Settings should feel **exciting**, not administrative
- Users should understand **business value**, not technical features
- Connection process should feel like **expanding capabilities**

### **Behavioral Changes**
- Increased system connections
- More diverse query types after new connections
- Reduced support tickets about setup

---

## **The Jobs Test**

After redesign, ask:
1. **"Does this feel magical?"** → Expanding AI intelligence should feel like gaining superpowers
2. **"Is the value obvious?"** → Users should immediately understand what becomes possible
3. **"Would I be excited to connect more systems?"** → Should feel like enhancement, not administration
4. **"Does this match the Mobius philosophy?"** → One continuous surface, not system management

---

## **Final Reminder**

Steve Jobs would say: *"People don't want to manage integrations. They want to expand their business intelligence. Make that the story."*

Transform this from technical plumbing into expanding the magic of what Mobius can do for their business.

You're right! The mock data in the Collections page is missing contact names or has them as "Unknown Contact". 

**Tell the Replit Agent:**

> Find the `invoices` array in the Collections page component and update ALL the contact names. Replace the entire invoices array with this:

```javascript
const invoices: Invoice[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    invoiceNumber: "INV-2024-001",
    customer: "Acme Corp",
    contactName: "Sarah Johnson", // This one is correct
    amount: 15750,
    daysPastDue: 45,
    relationshipScore: 85,
    aiRecommendation: "Send gentle reminder with payment plan options",
    recommendationConfidence: 94,
    approvalStatus: "pending",
    riskLevel: "medium",
    relationship: "valued partner",
    situation: "going through a tough quarter",
    aiMessage: "Based on their payment history and current market conditions, I recommend a supportive approach with flexible payment terms. They've been reliable for 3 years."
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    invoiceNumber: "INV-2024-002",
    customer: "TechFlow Solutions",
    contactName: "Michael Chen", // ADD THIS
    amount: 8500,
    daysPastDue: 30,
    relationshipScore: 92,
    aiRecommendation: "Friendly check-in call",
    recommendationConfidence: 87,
    approvalStatus: "pending",
    riskLevel: "low",
    relationship: "long-term client",
    situation: "likely oversight",
    aiMessage: "Their payment pattern suggests this is simply an oversight. A friendly reminder should resolve this quickly without any relationship damage."
  },
  {
    id: 3,
    invoiceNumber: "INV-2024-003",
    customer: "StartupXYZ",
    contactName: "David Park", // ADD THIS
    amount: 22000,
    daysPastDue: 65,
    relationshipScore: 62,
    aiRecommendation: "Escalate to collections agency",
    recommendationConfidence: 78,
    approvalStatus: "pending",
    riskLevel: "high",
    relationship: "new client",
    situation: "showing concerning payment patterns",
    aiMessage: "Multiple missed payments and declining communication. Time to escalate while preserving professional relationship for potential future recovery."
  }
];
```

**Make sure every invoice has a proper `contactName` field filled in.** If some are still showing "Unknown Contact", it means the code is trying to access the name from a different field or there's a rendering issue in the JSX.

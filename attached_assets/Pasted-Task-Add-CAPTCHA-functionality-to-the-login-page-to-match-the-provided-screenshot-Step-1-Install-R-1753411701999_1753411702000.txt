Task: Add CAPTCHA functionality to the login page to match the provided screenshot
Step 1: Install Required Dependencies
bashnpm install react-hook-form @hookform/resolvers zod react-google-recaptcha
npm install -D @types/react-google-recaptcha
Step 2: Replace the Login Page Component
Replace the entire contents of client/src/pages/login.tsx with the updated version that includes:

reCAPTCHA integration (only shows during sign-up)
Form validation using react-hook-form
Email updates checkbox
Terms and conditions text
Improved styling to match the screenshot
Password confirmation field for sign-up
Proper error handling for CAPTCHA validation

The new component should:

Use useForm from react-hook-form for form management
Include a ReCAPTCHA component that only appears during sign-up
Add proper validation for email, password, and password confirmation
Include an email updates checkbox for sign-up mode
Show terms and conditions text during sign-up
Disable the submit button until CAPTCHA is completed (for sign-up)
Reset CAPTCHA on form errors
Maintain the existing authentication flow with the backend

Step 3: Add Environment Variable
Add to your .env file:
REACT_APP_RECAPTCHA_SITE_KEY=6LeIxAcTAAAAAJcZVRqyHh71UMIEGNQ_MXjiZKhI
(This is Google's test key for development - replace with your actual key for production)
Step 4: Update Backend (if needed)
Ensure your backend authentication endpoints can handle:

captchaToken field in the request body
emailUpdates boolean field
Verification of the CAPTCHA token with Google's API

Key Requirements:

CAPTCHA should only appear during sign-up, not login
Form should use proper validation with clear error messages
Submit button should be disabled until CAPTCHA is completed (sign-up only)
Maintain existing authentication flow and navigation
Style should match the clean, modern look of the screenshot
Include the email updates checkbox and terms text for sign-up

Expected Outcome:
The login page should now match the screenshot with a functional CAPTCHA system that prevents automated sign-ups while maintaining a smooth user experience for legitimate users.

# Complete Repository Replacement Instructions

## Current Situation
- This Replit contains a fully functional Mobius One application
- The GitHub repository https://github.com/rocoloco/mobius-one-v2 needs to be replaced with this code
- Collections page has been fixed and is working properly

## Option 1: Force Push from Replit (Recommended)

### Step 1: Set up GitHub Authentication
1. Go to GitHub.com → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give it a name like "Replit Mobius One"
4. Select scopes: `repo` (full control of private repositories)
5. Generate and copy the token

### Step 2: Configure Git in Replit Terminal
```bash
# Remove the git lock if it exists
rm -f .git/index.lock

# Configure git (replace with your GitHub username and token)
git config user.name "Your GitHub Username"
git config user.email "your.email@example.com"

# Update remote URL with authentication
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/rocoloco/mobius-one-v2.git

# Stage all changes
git add .

# Commit current state
git commit -m "Complete application rewrite with fixed collections page

- Fixed collections page syntax errors and functionality
- Fully functional AI-powered collections management
- Complete business intelligence platform
- All features working: authentication, AI analysis, invoice processing"

# Force push to completely replace GitHub repository
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## Option 2: Download and Re-upload (Alternative)

If git authentication fails:

1. **Download this entire repository**:
   - Use Replit's download feature or zip the project
   
2. **Delete and recreate the GitHub repository**:
   - Go to https://github.com/rocoloco/mobius-one-v2/settings
   - Scroll down and delete the repository
   - Create a new repository with the same name
   
3. **Upload the downloaded code**:
   - Use GitHub's web interface to upload files
   - Or clone the new empty repo and copy files manually
